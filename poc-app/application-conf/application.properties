## props for new Pack/Pub samples in my libs

## See build-v2.groovy
## My boolean to enable/disable publishing -pass apikey via script dont store in repo
## Side note can pass api as a cat of a file call prop in app-conf before groovyz

## njl - added  deploy props for CICS and DB2
tvt6031_cics_cicsplex=CICS01
tvt6031_cics_cmciport=1490
tvt6031_cics_rpl=DAT.CICS.LOAD
# See bind.props for DB2 Options

## njl - added isMQ for demo- any folder with mq in its name  
isMQ = true :: **/mq-pgms/*.cbl

#
# Build properties used by zAppBuild/build.groovy
# Comma separated list of additional application property files to load
# Supports both relative path (to ${application}/application-conf/) and absolute path
applicationPropFiles=file.properties,BMS.properties,Assembler.properties,Cobol.properties,LinkEdit.properties,bind.properties

#
# Comma separated list all source directories included in application build. Supports both absolute
# and relative paths.  Relative assumed to be relative to ${workspace}.
# ex: applicationSrcDirs=${application},/u/build/common/copybooks
# Used in pipeline
applicationSrcDirs=${application}
 

#
# Comma separated list of the build script processing order
#buildOrder=BMS.groovy,Assembler.groovy,Cobol.groovy,LinkEdit.groovy
# NJL - demo nonBuild.groovy
buildOrder=nonBuild.groovy,BMS.groovy,Assembler.groovy,Cobol.groovy,LinkEdit.groovy

#
# The main build branch.  Used for cloning collections for topic branch builds instead
# of rescanning the entire application.
mainBuildBranch=master

#
# exclude list used when scanning or running full build
excludeFileList=.*,**/*.properties,**/*.xml,**/*.groovy,**/*.md,**/application-conf/*.*

#
# Impact analysis resolution rules (JSON format)
impactResolutionRules=[${copybookRule},${bmsRule},${linkRule},${maclibRule}]


## NJL - Notes on rules 
## These rules are based on the KC topic Dependency search path-https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS6T76_1.1.0/dependency.html
## the syntax below define 1 of 3 possible filter combinations 
## filters are used to find dependencies like copybooks or macros 
## there are2 basic filters 
##     library  : SYSIB    - will look for dependencies in a collection with the LIB=SYSLIB (this is the default for CBL,ASM and PLI)
##     Category : ?        - a category is a file type define by the scanner like COPYBOOK, MACRO, LINK...
## you can use one or bother filters 
## searchPath is the folder to where file can be found - more info needed as these rules apply to impact and code scanner phases of a build
